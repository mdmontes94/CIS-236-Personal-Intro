            <h3>Favorite culture I am not native to</h3>
            <p>Italy has millennia of history to dive into, amazing architecture, beautiful landscapes, and it would be
               a fantastic opportunity to be able to sample all of food and wine that is made there!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <h3>Two historical figures I relate to/admire</h3>
            <p>John Steinbeck is one of my favorite authors and the imagery in his writings is some of the best I have read
               and has stayed with me throughout my life; Bandit from Bluey is another figure that I relate to as his 
               approach to fatherhood is one I want to try to emulate, especially to the enjoyment of my daughter, even though
               he is "just" a cartoon dog!</p>

            <h3>A meal that represents me</h3>
            <p>I feel like a meal that would represent me would be some pork tamales with refried beans and spanish rice on the side.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <h3>"I feel the most creative when I..."</h3>
            <p>...am listening to music, or when I am on a hike. Most likely while both are occuring at the same time!</p>
